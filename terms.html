                                materials (information or software) on Linkroid's web site for personal,
                                non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a
                                transfer of title, and under this license you may not: modify or copy the materials;
                                use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial
                                or non-commercial); attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained
                                on Linkroid's web site; remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the
                                materials; or transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on
                                any other server. This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of
                                these restrictions and may be terminated by Linkroid at any time. Upon terminating
                                your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this license, you must
                                destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed

                                makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all
                                other warranties, including without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of

                                warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or
                                reliability of the use of the materials on its Internet web site or otherwise

                                11. With regard to content hosted on Linkroid's servers, it is Linkroid's policy to
                                block access to or remove material that it believes in good faith to be copyrighted
                                material that has been illegally copied and distributed by any of our advertisers,
                                affiliates, content providers, members or users; and remove account.

                                12. If you receive what you believe to be a phishing email with Linkroid URLs inside,

                                13. GDPR compliant feature: Linkroid provides a simple and easy to use mechanism for
                                collecting European visitors consents every-time they click on any of shorten links.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                13.1. The GDPR compliant feature is only based on some basic requirements in the
                                GDPR, it is therefore not a complete guarantee requirements set out in the GDPR.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                13.2. Linkroid is designed as a service to facilitate compliance with EU regulations
                                concerning the use of cookies on your website and to help you obtain the relevant
                                consents to the use of cookies from the users of your website. Linkroid is only the
                                service provider of the IT infrastructure, and it is your own responsibility to
                                ensure correct implementation and provide relevant input to the system. The relevant
                                EU legislation is not necessarily implemented in the same way in all EU countries,
                                and we cannot guarantee that using Linkroid will automatically lead to compliance
                                with all relevant rules and regulations concerning the use of cookies or the
                                collection of consents to the use of cookies. We encourage you to seek local legal
                                advice to ensure compliance with local legislation when implementing the solution on
                                your website and to tailor the wording of the consents to be shown on your website.
